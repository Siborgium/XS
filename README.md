XS: The eXtensible Shell
========================

This is `xs 1.3`; see `doc/CHANGES`.

XS is the eXtensible Shell, a command line interpreter featuring
Lisp-like semantics (lists, function parameters, closures, exceptions,
lexical bindings, lambdas, etc.) and a conventional syntax.

The package includes extensive documentation. Sample scripts to define
library functions, tools and utilities are found in
\<https://github.com/TieDyedDevil/XS-library.git>.
